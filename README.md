WebComponents.net
=================

According to The W3C Web Applications (WebApps) Working Group, Web Components are "the component model for the Web"
and include specifications for the following features:
  - Templates, which define chunks of markup that are inert but can be activated for use later.
  - Decorators, which define chunks of markup that are inert but can be activated for use later.
  - Custom Elements, which let authors define their own elements, with new tag names and new script interfaces.
  - Shadow DOM, which encapsulates a DOM subtree for more reliable composition of user interface elements.
  - Imports, which defines how templates, decorators and custom elements are packaged and loaded as a resource.
This project aims to provide tools to easily incorporate these features into ASP.NET-based web sites.  The initial emphasis is on ASP.NET MVC projects utilizing Razor and C#, but the intent is to develop tools and utilities that will be appropriate for any ASP.NET web site, regardless of flavor.
